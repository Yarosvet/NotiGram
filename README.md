# NotiGram - send notifications to Telegram ðŸ””

## Run
It's recommended to use Docker to run the bot.<br>
Firstly pull the image from the Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull yarosvetk/notigram
```
Then run the container (Don't forget to set the environment variables):
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 notigram -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_token -e REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
```
Obtain the token from the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

If you don't have a Redis server, you should run one (Let's use docker again):
```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```
(Runs Redis on the default port 6379 in background)

## Run without Docker
If you don't want to use Docker, you can run the bot directly on your machine.<br>
Firstly, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yarosvet/NotiGram.git
cd NotiGram
```
Then install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And run the bot using Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

## Usage
Users can subscribe to channels and receive notifications from them.<br>
You can subscribe to a channel by pressing the _Subscribe_ button and entering the channel id.<br>
Also links like `t.me/your_bot_username?start=CHANNEL_ID` can be used to subscribe to a channel.

To send a notification to a channel, you should send a POST request to the `/notification` endpoint with argument `channel_id`.
Place your message in the body of the request (Content type is `text/plain`).

Example:
```
POST https://your_server.com/notification?channel_id=your_channel_id

Content-Type: text/plain

Your message here
```

Everybody who subscribed to the channel will receive the message.

You don't need to configure channels, `channel_id` could be any string, and everyone who knows it can subscribe and receive notifications.

## Environment variables

Feel free to use the following environment variables to customize the bot

(For example, translate messages to your language)
